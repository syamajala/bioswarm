Bioswarm simulator. 

We simulate ants and fireflies. Ants try to seek out food in a scene
and bring it back to their hive. Fireflies roam about flashing and
trying to find the closest neighbor with a brighter flash than them. 

The test scene simulates 500 ants and 500 fireflies for 1000 frames
with 1 food group for ants. It is run simply by running make and 
./BioSwarm. In our test the scene took 445.139943657000003 seconds
(approximately 7.41 minutes) to render. The output file output.bswarm 
can then be visualized in Blender using the script view_bswarm.py in viz. 
Simply open the script in Blender's texteditor, modify the sim_data 
variable to contain the correct path of the output.bswarm file and click 
run script. The scene can then be viewed in Blender's 3d view. 

Functionality tests can be built using make test, and running the resulting
test binary.
