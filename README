BioSwarm -- Parallel Programming Project

Overview
---------------
BioSwarm is a simulation of a few types of insects in an environment with dynamically changing metabolisms and attributes such as food, hazards, and chemical/physical markers (pheromones, light flashes, etc).

Phase One
---------------
A serial implementation of our project to figure out algorithms and expected behavior.


Phase Two
---------------
A parallelized version of phase one with algorithms that run on multiple places and threads.
